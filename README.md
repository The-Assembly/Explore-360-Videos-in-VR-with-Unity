# Explore-360-Videos-in-VR-with-Unity
Unity 3D is a versatile cross-platform development engine that we’ve used many times in the past for game development and augmented/virtual reality apps.  

In this session, we’ll develop a Unity application that lets us bring any 360-degree video natively into our virtual environment with 3D scrollability. With the help of the Google Cardboard plugin, we’ll make our VR experience fully stereoscopic and hands-free, ready to be ported into any headset.  

Prerequisites: 
—Basic knowledge of Unity —Unity Version 2019.3: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive 
—Google Cardboard XR Plugin for Unity: https://github.com/googlevr/cardboard-xr-plugin
